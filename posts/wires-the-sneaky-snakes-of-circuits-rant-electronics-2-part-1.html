First prize. Fame. Recognition. Possibly even a <strong>Nobel Peace Prize</strong>.<br />I just needed this one <mark>light</mark> to behave.</p><p><img src="../images/rant-electronics/wires-the-sneaky-snakes-of-circuits-rant-electronics-2-part-1/1.png" alt class=\"image--center mx-auto\" /></p><p>I summoned every last brain cell I had left, trying to fix both my <strong>life</strong> and this <strong>corpse of a circuit</strong>. I've always trusted my sanity to guide me, only to be left traumatized by these <em><mark>pesky schematic snakes</mark></em>.</p><p>My eyes traced every wire back to its source and beyond.<br /><em>(I wish I had wired it with some respect and hygiene.)</em></p><blockquote><p>“Where is this blue one going?”<br />“The red one was for ground!”<br />“The green one was just for decoration — why is it connected to the hamster!?”<br />“<strong>THAT’S NOT HOW YOU GENERATE POWER FROM A RODENT!!!</strong>”</p></blockquote><p>While I was busy educating my neighbors on <strong>why you can’t generate electricity from an <mark>uncooperative rodent overlord</mark></strong> (<em>please, accept this scientific truth</em>),<br />a <strong>chill</strong> crawled down my spine.</p><p>Sweat trickled from my forehead to my back.<br />The air turned silent — not peaceful, but <strong>ominous</strong>.<br /><mark>Alive with vengeance</mark>.<br />And cold... not just any cold —<br /><strong>cold like ungrounded metal.</strong></p><p>Then it happened.</p><blockquote><p><strong>“HEY YOU! FAT, LAZY, GULLIBLE WORM WHO STILL SLEEPS WITH TEDDY BEARS!!!”</strong></p></blockquote><p>I turned, eyes wide, as those words <strong>slapped my eardrums</strong> and <strong>peeled <mark>onions of truth</mark></strong> inside my soul.<br />Tears threatened to fall.</p><blockquote><p>“You…? I thought you were—”</p><p><strong>“YES. My death was greatly exaggerated!”</strong>,<br />bellowed <em>The Switch.</em><br />My old nemesis. My ex-roommate.<br />The gatekeeper of conductivity.<br /><strong>The <mark>Unforgiving Plastic Judge</mark>.</strong></p></blockquote><p>There he stood — <strong><em>The Mighty Switch</em></strong> — at the wooden door, gripping his phone like a <em>lawyer with screenshots</em>, fuming with the wrath of a thousand blown fuses.</p><p><img src="../images/rant-electronics/wires-the-sneaky-snakes-of-circuits-rant-electronics-2-part-1/2.png" alt class=\"image--center mx-auto\" /></p><p>He raged like he’d been stuck in the <strong>ON</strong> position <mark>since the </mark> <strong><mark>Industrial Revolution</mark></strong>.<br />His <strong>bakelite casing</strong> creaked with suppressed rage.<br />(<em>Read my</em> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://siliconpen.com/the-mighty-switch-rant-electronics-1\"><em>previous post</em></a> <em>to understand the trauma this creature brings, thank you.</em>)</p><blockquote><p>“I can explain!”,<br />I cried like a villain caught red-handed with a soldering iron.</p><p><strong>“NO EXPLANATION IS NEEDED. I WILL SEE YOU IN COURT!”</strong><br /><em>He paused.</em><br />“…btw, you didn’t connect the battery.”</p></blockquote><p>And just like that, <strong>The Switch vanished</strong> — leaving behind a stunned and sweaty me.<br />I <mark>rolled on the floor</mark> for the next <strong>three hours</strong>, questioning my existence and whispering sweet nothings to my <strong>multimeter</strong>.</p><hr class="section-divider"/><h2 id=\"heading-the-pathways-powering-your-air-fryer\"><strong>The Pathways Powering Your Air Fryer</strong></h2><p>You’ve got a <strong>battery</strong>, an <strong>air fryer</strong>, fresh <strong>potatoes</strong>, <strong>spices</strong>, <strong>mayo</strong>, <strong>Netflix</strong>, and your <strong>pillow</strong> to comfort you r <mark>ever single life</mark> — the recipe for the perfect chill day. It <em>could’ve</em> been flawless... <strong>if only</strong> your connecting wire hadn’t decided to betray you.<br /><em>Aww, sucks right?</em></p><p>I <strong>k n o w</strong>. But seriously, why do we even <em>need</em> these <mark>sneaky snakes</mark> in our lives?<br />All they do is backstab you at the worst possible moment! These insulated coils, slithering around your house like the world’s most annoying pets.</p><p>It’s not too late — we should unite before they actually <strong>take over</strong>.<br />These <mark>brainless creatures</mark> don’t do jack on their own. Rather they are carriers of the message of their master.</p><p>Probably the descendants of <strong><em><mark>Jörmungandr</mark></em></strong> himself, coiling around the world as we edge ever closer to <strong><em><mark>Ragnarök</mark></em></strong><mark>.</mark></p><blockquote><p><strong><em>OH SHIT — IT’S PULLING MY LEG!!</em></strong></p></blockquote><hr class="section-divider"/><h2 id=\"heading-the-metallic-mafia-how-copper-got-all-the-connections\">The Metallic Mafia: How Copper Got All the Connections</h2><p><strong>What exactly is a wire?</strong><br />It’s a <strong>conductor</strong>.</p><p><em>Conductor?</em> Oh, I know — <mark>jargon alert</mark>! I hate it too. But basically, it’s a material that lets electrons flow through it. In other words, it lets electricity pass.</p><p>Many things can be conductors: metals, water, even you (yes, you’re a conductor!). “<em>But</em> <strong><em>never</em></strong> <em>try poking your fingers into a socket unless you want a very <mark>shocking verification</mark> of that fact.”</em></p><p>The wires you see around are made of <strong>metals</strong>. Why?, and wait, aren’t metals supposed to be big, fat, and heavy? Like Thor’s mighty hammer, Mjölnir?</p><p><em>(Because hey, <mark>Thor’s Mjölnir</mark> does conduct electricity — lightning and all that <mark>:D</mark>)</em></p><p>But the answer is... <strong>NO</strong>. Well, kind of yes, but mostly no.</p><p>Metals are <strong>great conductors</strong> of electricity because they let electrons flow through them <strong>easily</strong> and hence used in wires.</p><h3 id=\"heading-why-do-we-even-care-about-good-conductors\"><strong>Why Do We Even Care About Good Conductors?</strong></h3><p>Why metals and not the <mark>poor Billy</mark>? (He’s out there yelling, <em>“I wanna be Electrooo!”</em>)</p><p>Well, <strong>several reasons, dude</strong>:</p><ul><li><p>So your house doesn’t transform into a <mark>DIY fireworks factory</mark> every time you charge your phone.</p></li><li><p>So electricity flows like a chill river, not like an anxious crowd in a concert.</p></li><li><p>So your precious devices don’t randomly explode mid-binge, leaving you on a cliffhanger <strong>literally</strong>.</p></li><li><p>So I don’t <mark>end up in jail</mark> for letting Billy lick the fuse box again. (He said it was spicy.)</p></li></ul><p>In short, <strong>good conductors keep the power smooth, the sparks invisible, and your hair non-frizzy</strong>.</p><p>Wanna know how?<br />Too late. <em>Dragging you by the resistance</em> — off course you wanna know!</p><hr class="section-divider"/><h2 id=\"heading-the-chemistry-of-materials-the-epic-family-feud\"><strong>The Chemistry of Materials: T</strong>he Epic Family Feud</h2><p>Tied you up? Good. Now listen.<br />(<em>You walked into this blog, you deal with the consequences</em>.)</p><p>So why do conductors let electricity flow like they’re <mark>club bouncers</mark> letting VIPs in without ID?<br />And why do insulators sit in the corner, arms crossed, seething with jealousy?</p><p>Here's your answer.<br /><strong>Unsolicited. <mark>Unapologetic</mark>. You’re welcome, dummy.</strong></p><p>The atoms of a conductor? <strong>Fat. Bloated. Like an <mark>old joint family</mark> that just refuses to move out.</strong> And the poor electrons on the edge? <strong>Ignored stepchildren.</strong> No love from the nucleus. No inheritance. So, what do they do?</p><p><strong><mark>They leave.</mark></strong> Yep. Just pack their quantum bags and bounce. Roaming around like emotionally damaged poets in a metal bar.</p><p><img src="../images/rant-electronics/wires-the-sneaky-snakes-of-circuits-rant-electronics-2-part-1/3.png" alt class=\"image--center mx-auto\" /></p><p>Now insulators?<br />Their nuclei are <strong>possessive desi moms</strong>.</p><blockquote><p>\"No beta, you can’t go outside! You’ll catch a cold. Or a bad influence. Or both.\"<br />Meanwhile, the electrons are 25, unemployed, and still not allowed to cross the street.</p></blockquote><p>So yeah, no free-roaming electrons = no party. Just a bunch of <mark>clingy atoms having a silent breakdown</mark>.</p><p>And now you're wondering,<br /><strong>\"Wait... why do we need free electrons anyway?\"</strong></p><p><strong>AND THAT, my friend, was your first mistake.</strong></p><hr class="section-divider"/><h2 id=\"heading-the-push-of-tyranny-voltage\">The Push of Tyranny: VOLTAGE</h2><p>Okay. So. We got these <mark>sad little electrons</mark> sitting around doing NOTHING. Just…vibing. **UNTIL—**some psycho comes in with a <em>battery</em> and goes, “MOVE.”</p><p>Ohhh you thought electricity just <em>happens</em>?<br />No, you beautiful <mark>uncharged idiot</mark>.<br />It needs <strong>motivation</strong>. A <strong>PUSH</strong>.<br />It needs… <strong>voltage</strong>.</p><p>Voltage is not some <mark>fancy sauce</mark> you pour into the wire.<br />It’s not “extra electricity.”<br />It’s <mark>that </mark> <em><mark>toxic manager</mark></em> screaming at the electrons to move their ass.<br />It’s pressure. It’s <em>expectation</em>.<br />Voltage is what happens when potential energy becomes peer pressure.</p><p>The battery? That shady little box?<br />It doesn’t <em>give</em> electrons. It gives them <strong>emotional damage</strong>.<br />It’s just sitting there like:</p><blockquote><p>“Move. NOW.”<br />And the electrons?<br />“Yes sir.”</p></blockquote><p><img src="../images/rant-electronics/wires-the-sneaky-snakes-of-circuits-rant-electronics-2-part-1/4.png" alt class=\"image--center mx-auto\" /></p><p>Electrons, those free-spirited trampy little subatomic poets we talked about earlier,<br />suddenly find themselves <em>part of a system</em>.<br />A system <mark>powered by guilt</mark> and Newton’s 3rd law.<br />The electron near the battery gets pushed,<br />and that one’s like:</p><blockquote><p>“Fine! But I’m pushing the guy in front too!”<br />And BOOM—domino effect.</p></blockquote><p>The whole wire starts trembling like it owes someone money.</p><p>BUT HERE’S THE KICKER.<br />These electrons? They move <strong>slow</strong>. Like, <mark>sloth-on-Nyquil </mark> slow.<br />Yet the bulb turns on <strong>instantly</strong>. Why?</p><p>Because it’s not about the <strong>individual electrons</strong>.<br />It’s the <strong><mark>wave of movement</mark></strong>.<br />Like a bar fight starting at one end and the whole crowd shuffling.<br />No one knows who started it.<br />Everyone’s moving.<br />Chaos.<br /><strong>Light.</strong></p><p><img src="../images/rant-electronics/wires-the-sneaky-snakes-of-circuits-rant-electronics-2-part-1/5.png" alt class=\"image--center mx-auto\" /></p><p>So what is a wire doing really?</p><p>It’s not “carrying electrons from the battery to your fan.” The wires already has the electrons.<br />It’s <strong><mark>transmitting a collective breakdown</mark>.</strong></p><p>A psychological stampede of electrons.<br />You’re not paying for electrons.<br />You’re <mark>paying to </mark> <strong><mark>traumatize</mark> them in one direction</strong>.</p><p>Now take a breath. The fan is spinning. The light’s on.<br />And somewhere, an electron cries.</p><hr class="section-divider"/><h2 id=\"heading-so-what-do-wires-actually-carry\">So What Do Wires <em>Actually</em> Carry?</h2><p><strong>Not electrons. Not current. Not hopes and dreams.</strong><br />They carry <strong>voltage</strong>.<br /><em>Force.</em> <em>Potential.</em> <em><mark>The PUSH</mark>.</em></p><p>You connect one end of a wire to something else?<br /><strong>That push continues.</strong> The same way your mom’s anger travels down the room without her even yelling. <mark>Pure presence</mark>.</p><p><strong>The appliance in the way?</strong> Acts like a grumpy old man <mark>slowing the whole train down</mark>.<br />It “resists” the flow. Hence—<em>resistance</em>. More load = more slowdown = needs more PUSH.</p><hr class="section-divider"/><h2 id=\"heading-but-why-does-current-stay-the-same-before-and-after-the-load\">But… Why Does Current Stay the Same Before and After the Load?</h2><p>Because they’re <em>linked</em>, bro. Like a <mark>conga line of guilt</mark>.<br />If the load in the middle is moving slow, the guy behind him and ahead of him also move slow.<br />It’s not about who wants to go fast—it’s about <strong>who CAN</strong>.<br />And if one <mark>dude’s stuck eating glue</mark>, the whole line moves like they’re on sedatives.</p><hr class="section-divider"/><h2 id=\"heading-wanna-hear-about-series-and-parallel-no-you-dont\">Wanna Hear About Series and Parallel? No You Don’t.</h2><p>But here’s a teaser:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Series:</strong> One fails? All cry. Like group projects.</p></li><li><p><strong>Parallel:</strong> One fails? Others keep going.
