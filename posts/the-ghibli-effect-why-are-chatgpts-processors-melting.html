          <p>“<em>Wanna make some Ghibli Art?</em>” “<em>Hey! Can you Ghiblify this?</em>” “<em>Bro, check out this anime-style portrait I created!</em>”<br />You’ve probably heard or seen posts like these if you're even mildly active on social media. And even if you're not, it’s almost impossible to miss the <em>Ghibli Art Trend</em> that took over the internet within just a month.<br />Yes, it's <em>that</em> trend — the one that got your friends, family, and even celebrities going wild over generative AI and its insane capabilities. It's the very reason your feed is now overflowing with cartoonish, dreamlike portraits of people.</p><p><img src="../images/the-ghibli-effect-why-are-chatgpts-processors-melting/1.webp" alt class=\"image--center mx-auto\" /></p><h1 id=\"heading-the-ghibli-trend-the-artstyle-shaking-the-internet\">The Ghibli Trend: The Artstyle Shaking the Internet</h1><p>It all began when Seattle-based software engineer Grant Slatton posted an AI-transformed photo of his family on X (formerly Twitter).</p><p><img src="../images/the-ghibli-effect-why-are-chatgpts-processors-melting/2.webp" alt class=\"image--center mx-auto\" /></p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/GrantSlatton/status/1904631016356274286\">Click here to view his post</a></p><p>His caption read:<br /><strong>“Tremendous alpha right now in sending your wife photos of y’all converted to Studio Ghibli anime.”</strong><br />This came shortly after OpenAI introduced its upgraded image-generation tools — and boom, the post went viral.</p><p>It instantly caught the attention of anime-loving youth, sparking a global wave of teenagers recreating their portraits in the Ghibli art style using AI. But it didn’t stop there — the trend quickly spread to the masses: from elderly parents to billion-dollar brands like Zomato and Swiggy, and even celebrities like Parineeti Chopra, Raghav Chadha, and Rakul Preet Singh — not to mention high-profile figures such as PM Modi and Elon Musk.</p><p><img src="../images/the-ghibli-effect-why-are-chatgpts-processors-melting/3.webp" alt class=\"image--center mx-auto\" /></p><p>The art style — with its soft colors, nostalgic vibes, and simple, nature-connected designs — captivated people instantly. It evokes a longing for a peaceful, simpler time, especially the kind we experienced in childhood. Many, especially from the older generation, crave the tranquility of a gadget-free countryside — one brimming with trees, bustling with folks and fauna. That distinct smell of wet earth, the soft rustling of trees, and the vibrant crackle of village life — all come rushing back. The Ghibli art style awakens those memories and lets you feel, see, and hear them all over again. That’s exactly what makes it so unique — and so irresistible.</p><p><img src="../images/the-ghibli-effect-why-are-chatgpts-processors-melting/4.webp" alt class=\"image--center mx-auto\" /></p><hr class="section-divider"/><h1 id=\"heading-ghibli-art-studio-the-legend-of-japanese-animation\">Ghibli Art Studio: The Legend of Japanese Animation</h1><p>Studio Ghibli is a renowned Japanese animation studio based in Koganei, Tokyo. It holds a powerful presence in the animation world and has expanded its creative footprint to include short films, television commercials, and even two TV movies. Over the years, its works have been celebrated by audiences globally and recognized with numerous prestigious awards.</p><p>The name “<strong>Ghibli</strong>” comes from the Italian word for the <strong>hot Sahara wind</strong>, symbolizing the studio’s aim to “<strong><em>blow a new wind through the anime industry.</em></strong>” And well — blow through it they did, sweeping across the globe with their unforgettable storytelling and art.</p><p>Founded in 1985 by legendary animator and filmmaker <strong>Hayao Miyazaki</strong>, alongside director <strong>Isao Takahata</strong> and producer <strong>Toshio Suzuki</strong>, the studio would go on to redefine what animation could be. (Starting from left: Hayao Miyazaki, Isao Takahata and Toshio Suzuki)</p><p><img src="../images/the-ghibli-effect-why-are-chatgpts-processors-melting/5.webp" alt class=\"image--center mx-auto\" /></p><p>The studio has produced more than <strong>22</strong> animated art works, which include feature films, short films, and commercials for television. Takahata and Miyazaki met for the first time in the 1960s while they were both employed at the Japanese animation studio Tôei Dôga. They collaborated for over ten years, but it was in the mid-1980s that they made the choice to establish their own company. In 1985, with backing from the publishing company Tokuma Shoten in Tokyo, Takahata, Miyazaki, and Suzuki initiated Studio Ghibli, a small studio located in the outskirts of Tokyo. This same Studio Ghibli has created <strong>15 of the top-grossing anime films</strong> in Japan.</p><p>Here is list of their works, incase I got you intrigued: (According to IMDb)</p><h2 id=\"heading-notable-works-by-studio-ghibli\">🎬 Notable Works by Studio Ghibli:</h2><ul><li><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2576852/?ref_=ls_t_1\">The Tale of The Princess Kaguya (2013)</a></p></li><li><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0245429/?ref_=ls_t_2\">Spirited Away (2001)</a></p></li><li><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3398268/?ref_=ls_t_3\">When Marnie Was There (2014)</a></p></li><li><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095327/?ref_=ls_t_4\">Grave of the Fireflies (1988)</a></p></li><li><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119698/?ref_=ls_t_5\">Princess Mononoke (1997)</a></p></li><li><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1568921/?ref_=ls_t_6\">The Secret World of Arrietty (2010)</a></p></li><li><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110008/?ref_=ls_t_7\">Pom Poko (1994)</a></p></li><li><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102587/?ref_=ls_t_8\">Only Yesterday (1991)</a></p></li><li><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096283/?ref_=ls_t_9\">My Neighbor Totoro (1988)</a></p></li><li><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2013293/?ref_=ls_t_10\">The Wind Rises (2013)</a></p></li><li><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087544/?ref_=ls_t_11\">Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (1984)</a></p></li><li><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0876563/?ref_=ls_t_12\">Ponyo (2008)</a></p></li></ul><p>All these are considered to be some of their best works.

On one side, art enthusiasts are concerned that AI-generated art may diminish the value and legacy of iconic studios like Ghibli. On the other, the tech-savvy crowd is raising questions about privacy and the vast amounts of data being collected from everyday users.</p><h2 id=\"heading-art-vs-ai-a-creative-dilemma\">🎨 Art vs AI: A Creative Dilemma</h2><p>The artistic community largely stands <strong>against</strong> this trend, arguing that it disrespects the studio’s legacy and reduces years of painstaking work by skilled animators into a casual, instant aesthetic. Some claim it's a mockery of the intricate craft that takes years to master.</p><p><strong>My perspective?</strong> This style should be referred to as a <strong>\"Ghibli-like\"</strong> art style rather than directly associating it with the original studio. After all, AI-generated images are recreations based on patterns and datasets used to train the model (we’ll explore that in more detail shortly). It can mimic the look, but it can never truly capture the <em>soul</em> of original Ghibli works—the emotion, the storytelling, the magic that breathes life into every frame.</p><p>At the same time, this trend could also serve as a gateway for new audiences to discover Studio Ghibli’s films, potentially boosting their visibility and improving their financial support.</p><h2 id=\"heading-fun-trend-or-privacy-breach\">🔒 Fun Trend or Privacy Breach?</h2><p>While the public is busy experimenting with AI-generated portraits, industry experts and tech leaders are voicing serious concerns. The core issue? Users are uploading large amounts of <strong>personal visual data</strong>, which, if mishandled, could lead to alarming consequences—such as data being sold on the dark web, the creation of deepfakes, or unauthorized profiling based on facial features and digital behavior.</p><p>In the digital age, <strong>data is everything</strong>—and the risks tied to it are real.</p><hr class="section-divider"/><p><em>We’ve explored the trend and its artistic roots, but now it’s time to step into our zone: the tech behind the magic. How does ChatGPT generate such stunning visuals? What exactly is</em> <strong><em>Generative AI</em></strong>, and how does it work under the hood?*</p><p><strong><em>Let’s break it down!</em></strong></p><h1 id=\"heading-from-code-to-canvas-the-rise-of-generative-ai\">From Code to Canvas: The Rise of Generative AI</h1><h2 id=\"heading-dive-into-the-history-of-ai\">🧠 Dive into the History of AI</h2><p>The human mind’s craving for automation and artificial life isn’t a modern phenomenon — it dates back to ancient legends and myths.</p><p>Take <strong>Daedalus</strong> from Greek mythology, for instance. He’s known for designing the Labyrinth and crafting wings for himself and his son Icarus to escape Crete. But beyond that, Daedalus was also credited with creating <strong>moving statues, self-operating devices, and automata</strong> — mythological, of course, but symbolically, he’s considered a <strong>proto-engineer</strong> or the <strong>mythical father of robotics and automation</strong>.</p><p>Then comes <strong>Hero of Alexandria</strong>, who designed the <strong>Aeolipile</strong> — the first recorded steam engine. His inventions included self-moving mechanisms and even programmable machines, making him one of the earliest real-world pioneers of mechanical automation. Centuries later, those seeds would evolve into the digital and intelligent systems we now call <strong>AI</strong>.</p><p><img src="../images/the-ghibli-effect-why-are-chatgpts-processors-melting/7.webp" alt class=\"image--center mx-auto\" /></p><p><strong>Stepping into the real world…</strong></p><p>In the 1950s, <strong>Alan Turing</strong> dared to ask, <em>“Can machines think?”</em> and laid the first stone of the AI revolution by proposing the <strong>Turing Test</strong> — a method to evaluate whether a machine can imitate human responses well enough to pass as intelligent. This sparked a global curiosity, and soon researchers began experimenting with various ways to simulate human intelligence. Some of the earliest attempts came in the 1950s and 60s, using <strong>if-else rules</strong> to program logic and decision-making.</p><p><img src="../images/the-ghibli-effect-why-are-chatgpts-processors-melting/8.webp" alt class=\"image--center mx-auto\" /></p><p>From the <strong>1990s to 2010s</strong>, the focus shifted to <strong>Machine Learning (ML)</strong> — where models didn’t need rules hard-coded but could <strong>learn patterns from data</strong> and build their own decision paths. Then came the breakthrough: <strong>Neural Networks</strong>, which gained popularity after 2010. These systems were inspired by the human brain and could absorb vast amounts of data to recognize patterns, powering tools like <strong>image classifiers</strong>, <strong>voice assistants</strong>, and <strong>language translators</strong>.</p><p>But <strong>2014</strong> changed everything — <strong>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)</strong> were introduced by Ian Goodfellow, allowing machines to create. From generating <strong>realistic faces</strong> (This Person Does Not Exist), to <strong>art styles</strong>, and even <strong>deepfakes</strong>, GANs sparked the beginning of <strong>artificial creativity</strong>.</p><p>In <strong>2017</strong>, the arrival of <strong>Transformers</strong> gave birth to a new era. These models could understand context in language like never before, leading to the rise of <strong>BERT</strong>, <strong>GPT</strong>, and eventually <strong>ChatGPT</strong>, which could <strong>write, reason, and talk</strong> almost like a human.</p><p>Finally, in the <strong>2020s</strong>, <strong>Generative AI (GenAI)</strong> became a household name. Tools like <strong>DALL·E</strong>, <strong>Stable Diffusion</strong>, <strong>Midjourney</strong>, and <strong>ChatGPT</strong> made it possible to create <strong>text, images, music, code</strong>, and even <strong>videos</strong>, all from a simple prompt — flooding the internet and opening a new chapter in human-tech collaboration.</p><h2 id=\"heading-ai-models-giving-life-to-code\">🤖AI Models: Giving Life To Code</h2><p><strong>Here we are gonna discuss the learning process of AI.</strong></p><p>Imagine a kid learning to identify mangoes. At first, they’re simply shown lots of mangoes — yellow ones, green ones, big ones, small ones — until they start to form a mental image of what a “mango” is. That’s the training phase.</p><p>Next, we mix in apples, oranges, and bananas and ask: “Is this a mango?” Every time the kid guesses right, they’re praised. If they mess up, they’re corrected. Slowly, they refine their concept. That’s the testing and feedback phase.</p><p><img src="../images/the-ghibli-effect-why-are-chatgpts-processors-melting/9.jpeg" alt class=\"image--center mx-auto\" /></p><p>Now take this trained kid to a fruit shop in another country — new lighting, different mango breeds — and boom, the kid can still pick out the mangoes. That’s generalization — applying what was learned to unseen data.</p><p>That’s exactly how AI learns. It starts with data, forms patterns, gets feedback, and slowly becomes good enough to handle things it’s never seen before.</p><p><strong>Coming to different types of Machine Learning models, we have three major types:</strong></p><ol><li><p><strong>Decision Tree</strong>: The classic "if-else" logic — great for straightforward decisions. It asks a predefined list of questions like:<br /> <em>“Is it yellow?”</em><br /> <em>“Is it sweet?”</em><br /> If yes, then boom — <em>"It's a mango!"</em></p></li><li><p><strong>Linear Regression</strong>: Predicts based on trendlines. For example, older people tend to be taller, so based on age, we can <em>predict</em> that a 23-year-old will be taller than an 8-year-old.</p></li><li><p><strong>Neural Network</strong>: Inspired by the human brain — a web of artificial “neurons” that learn patterns from data. This one’s a game-changer. Unlike decision trees, neural networks evolve. The questions aren’t fixed — they adapt and grow more complex as new patterns emerge.</p></li></ol><blockquote><p>You can think of neural networks as a group of smaller AIs, each learning different aspects of the same problem. Together, they collaborate, refine, and evolve the questions they ask — often discovering connections beyond human intuition.</p></blockquote><details><summary>Quick Discussions: Decision Tree v/s Neural Networks</summary><div data-type=\"detailsContent\"><strong>Decision Trees</strong> are like the logical thinkers of the AI world. They are given variales and preferences and ask questions regarding the thresholds—and follow the yes/no paths until they land on a decision. They’re fast, interpretable, and efficient for structured data. You can trace exactly how a decision was made, making them a favorite in scenarios where transparency matters—like loan approvals or medical diagnoses. <strong>Neural Networks</strong>, on the other hand, are the dreamers. Inspired by the human brain, they don’t follow fixed questions but learn patterns through layers upon layers of mathematical connections. They thrive in messy, high-dimensional spaces like images, language, and sound. Their strength lies in abstraction—they don’t just find patterns, they <em>build</em> understanding. But they’re a black box; you can’t always see why they made a choice, only that it often works... and sometimes, <em>really</em> works. They create their own questions.</div></details><p>These are the building blocks. And GenAI? It's the masterpiece built on them.</p><h2 id=\"heading-generative-ai-miracle-of-the-silicon-world\">🎨Generative AI: Miracle Of the Silicon World</h2><p>Generative AI are special type of AI models, which are particular trained to entirely new data, which resembles the patterns it learnt from the dataset provided to it. As we already saw the multitude of appplications it have. Traditionally, there are two types of AI.</p><p>Discriminative AI—used to classify and cateorize data. Eg- gets it is trained to identify cat using big dataset of cat images. Then it would be capable to identify new images of cat it haven’t seen before.</p><p>Generative AI—used to create new data using previous data.</p><p><img src="../images/the-ghibli-effect-why-are-chatgpts-processors-melting/10.webp" alt class=\"image--center mx-auto\" /></p><p>“<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.freepik.com/free-ai-image/futuristic-computer-graphic-glowing-human-face-generative-ai_40964102.htm\"><em>Image by vecstock on Freepik</em></a>”</p><p>Till now we discussed that neural networks find patterns. Now we will talk about, the technique used to learn those patterns. (The types of neural network Models)</p><p>GAN (Generative Adversirial Netwokrs): The most prominent model used for GenAI. It works using a generator and discriminator. The generator try to generate new data, like image, text, voice etc using the given dataset, while the discriminator tries to understand or classify them according to the given data. Then the discriminator sends data to the generator which learns how closely it created the data resembling the original material. Then the generator improves. Mostly used for deepfakes, voices, image etc. Eg - CycleGAN</p><p></p><details><summary>Poetic Analogy</summary><div data-type=\"detailsContent\">Imagine an artist painting a portrait from imagination. Standing beside them is a strict critic, always yelling. The artist keeps painting. Fails. Learns. Improves. The critic keeps judging. Sharpening its taste. This <em>adversarial dance</em> continues — until one day, the portrait is so perfect, even the critic is fooled. They battle in silence, and from their fight... <strong>beauty is born</strong>.</div></details><img src="../images/the-ghibli-effect-why-are-chatgpts-processors-melting/11.webp" alt /><p></p><p>Diffusion Models: It takes a image, then add layers of noise to it (damages it) then tries to denoise it back to original (fixes) and find patterns. Then we provide it with photos with just noise and it removes the noise in such a way that it forms the original images. It is used for images because it develops intricit relations among the pixels. Eg - DallE and Midjourney.</p><p></p><details><summary>Poetic Analogy</summary><div data-type=\"detailsContent\">Imagine you have a faint line sketch buried under a heap of sand. A diffusion model learns how to <strong>gently blow away that sand</strong>, grain by grain, until the original sketch emerges. That’s how it learns. Then, reverse the process. Now you give it <strong>just sand</strong>, and because it’s mastered the art of uncovering patterns, it <strong>generates a whole new sketch</strong> from pure noise — grain by grain, thought by thought. Diffusion models don’t just recreate—they <strong>generate</strong>, with realism born from randomness.</div></details><img src="../images/the-ghibli-effect-why-are-chatgpts-processors-melting/12.webp" alt /><p></p><p>Transformer Models: Transformers are a type of neural network architecture designed to handle sequential data, but unlike earlier models, they do so <strong>without relying on sequence order</strong>. Instead, they use a mechanism called <strong>self-attention</strong>, which allows the model to evaluate the importance of each part of the input relative to the others. Eg- ChatGPT.</p><p></p><details><summary>Poetic Analogy</summary><div data-type=\"detailsContent\">Imagine you're reading a book, and by the time you reach the last page, you still remember what was on page one. You not only remember — you know <em>which parts were important</em>. That’s how Transformers work. They're not like old-school models that read word by word and forget what came before. <strong>Transformers do it all at once. Boom. Parallelly. Attention — or more specifically, Self-Attention. </strong>Every word looks at every other word and asks: “Are <em>you</em> important to me?” “Should I care about you while I’m figuring myself out?”. The result? A model that understands: Context, Emotion, Meaning, and how every word relates to every other — like a cosmic web of language.</div></details><img src="../images/the-ghibli-effect-why-are-chatgpts-processors-melting/13.webp" alt /><p></p><h2 id=\"heading-whats-the-difference-between-generative-ai-and-chatgpt\"><strong>What’s the Difference Between Generative AI and ChatGPT?</strong></h2><p><strong>Generative AI</strong> is a broad category of artificial intelligence focused on creating new content — whether it’s text, images, music, videos, or even simulations.

But as AI began to grow, the limitations of CPUs became evident—they simply lacked the parallel processing muscle needed for complex tasks.</p><blockquote><p>“Think of CPUs like a fast chef working alone. Efficient for simple meals, but overwhelmed if asked to cook 50 dishes at once.“</p></blockquote><p>This led to the rise of <strong>multi-core and heterogeneous computing</strong>, with pioneers like <strong>IBM’s Cell processor</strong> combining general-purpose cores with specialized elements for parallel workloads.</p><blockquote><p>“This was like bringing sous-chefs to help the main chef—each handling specific parts of the meal.”</p></blockquote><p>Then came the <strong>GPU revolution</strong>—parallel powerhouses originally built for graphics rendering, now repurposed for AI. Their ability to perform massive parallel mathematical operations made <strong>deep learning practically possible</strong>.</p><blockquote><p>“Now you have a kitchen full of chefs, each making small parts of the dish at once — super fast and efficient for big recipes (like training neural networks).“</p></blockquote><p>But even GPUs had their flaws—high power consumption and a design not purely optimized for AI. That’s when <strong>Neural Processing Units (NPUs)</strong> emerged. <strong>Purpose-built for neural networks</strong>, these chips brought <strong>unmatched speed, energy efficiency, and edge-readiness</strong> to AI acceleration.</p><blockquote><p>“NPUs are like robotic arms built only to cook a specific dish — not flexible, but insanely good at that one thing. Perfect for embedded or mobile devices where energy &amp; speed matter.“</p></blockquote><h2 id=\"heading-the-age-of-ai-chips-rewriting-the-future-of-hardware\">The Age of AI Chips: Rewriting the Future of Hardware</h2><p>In the final act of AI’s hardware evolution, we arrive at a new breed of silicon—<strong>AI Chips</strong>.</p><p>Unlike general-purpose processors or even specialized NPUs, <strong>AI chips are tailor-made</strong> to run machine learning workloads with <strong>maximum efficiency, speed, and minimal power draw</strong>. They're not just accelerators—they are <strong>native environments</strong> for AI logic to thrive. From <strong>Apple's Neural Engine</strong> to <strong>Google's TPU</strong> and <strong>custom silicon in edge devices</strong>, these chips are redefining what \"hardware\" means in the age of intelligence.</p><p>But the trajectory doesn't stop there.</p><p><img src="../images/the-ghibli-effect-why-are-chatgpts-processors-melting/16.webp" alt class=\"image--center mx-auto\" /></p><p>“<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.freepik.com/free-ai-image/ai-powered-device-concept_408670759.htm#fromView=search&amp;page=1&amp;position=2&amp;uuid=a7ec3560-6c1b-46f2-b0fd-5a5802c8649d&amp;query=AI+chips\"><em>Image by freepik</em></a>”</p><p>As these chips become more integrated into our everyday hardware—from phones and cars to appliances and wearables—they are <strong>poised to replace traditional processing units like the FPU (Floating Point Unit)</strong> and even <strong>dedicated NPUs</strong>, evolving into <strong>a unified processing system designed for intelligent computation</strong> at every level.</p><p><strong>SO, at the end:)</strong><br />Do you think AI-generated art adds value or steals from tradition?
